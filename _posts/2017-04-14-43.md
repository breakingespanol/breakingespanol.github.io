This is a tough week! We’re losing our Nanny due to the schedule not working for her, so we’re looking into preschools. Fortunately, we have some good prospects on bilingual preschools in our area, so we’re hopeful to find one soon. Jennie also recently went to Tijuana for a six course (platos) dinner from local chefs in the Playas area. In her dinner, she realized, again, how hard it is to translate menus.
