We continue to start off  the show speaking in Spanish. Jennie’s back from Chile and ready to share about her time in Santiago and the coastline of Chile. She loved speaking in Spanish while there and has some fun experiences to share. We couldn’t fit it all in one episode so catch part 2 next week!

We also started a new community over on Patreon where you can support the show and continue our Spanish converstaions. Ciao!

¡Gracias por escuchar!
