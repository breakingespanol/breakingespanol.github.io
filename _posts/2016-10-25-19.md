This week we catch up with our learning journey. We had a class with Lalo so we have lots of words and phrases to share. As well, we are planning a trip to Oaxaca and in doing so had to navigate making the travel arrangements in Spanish over email. This posed a challenge but we got through it and share our tips on how you can navigate these situations also.

In looking for a place in Oaxaca we discovered a few great Bed and Breakfast (BnB) to stay and ended up choosing one near the heart of town. A perfect location to experience the Oaxacan culture and people. We’re excited about this old city as it has some serious roots in pre-hispanic cooking and customs.

Also this week, Ben discovered a book series on Audible containing 9 short stories for beginners. On a recent work trip he only had time to listen to one, but rest assured you’ll hear more about them in coming weeks.

¡Gracias por Escuchar!
