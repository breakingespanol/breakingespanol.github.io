This week Jennie and Ben went to a local Mexican restaurant in Barrio Logan, a very authentic Mexican area near downtown San Diego. At the restaurant they had a really authentic experience ordering, eating, and chatting w/ the ladies making all the food.

The place is staffed by a bunch of old(er) Mexicanas that do things the traditional way. When you ask for Carne, it means pork. There are only about 3 or 4 items on the menu, and it’s cash only. The name? Las Cuatros Milpas which means “The four cornfields”.

If you’re in San Diego ever and looking for an authentic Mexican meal, this is one of the best places to try. Beware though, there is nothing gluten-free, vegetarian, or vegan here, just pure traditional Mexican style food.
