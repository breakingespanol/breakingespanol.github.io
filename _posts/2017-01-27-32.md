This is our first part of our 3 part series about our recent trip to Oaxaca, Mexico! We were really nervous for this trip because our son Jack was sick just prior but he recovered just in time and loved the trip down. While in Oaxaca we recorded a few episodes on the terrace outside our room so you'll get the authentic sounds and our experience there. ¡Gracias por Escuchar!
