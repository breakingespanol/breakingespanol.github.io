In this episode we talk about our journey to this point, how we got to this point, and what we do to try and keep learning.

## Tips

- We try to use Spanish every day, especially in the morning
- For us, the most efficient way to learn is by taking in-person lessons (group or individual)
- Translation apps are helpful for vocab, but don’t really help you learn
- Learning together has been really helpful for us
- It’s natural to be nervous when trying to speak with people that are first language Spanish speakers
- Ask people to speak slowly when you’re trying to communicate
- If trying to have a conversation with someone, let them know you’re learning beforehand
- Try to understand the meaning of the words rather than translating word for word
- The goal is to “think in Spanish"
- Make duolingo a routine
- Join an online group and look for people you come across regularly that speak spanish
