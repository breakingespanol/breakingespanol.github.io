This week we have a very special guest, Aileen Passariello McAleer, a co-founder of our favorite app, Mama Lingua!

Aileen shares her story of growing up bilingual with her parents and three siblings. Originally from Miami, she spent every summer in Venezuela, where her family is from. Now with two kids or her own she shares her tips for balancing the languages in her household.

She was raised bilingual with Venezualean parents and is now raising her two kids bilingual so we recently got together to talk about the app she created. How much Spanish her kids really know and she has a bunch of great tips for anyone raising their kids bilingual. She also shares her story about creating her app and what their goals are with it. Enjoy!
