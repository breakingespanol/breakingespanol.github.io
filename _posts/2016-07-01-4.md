We're trying a new format this week! The new format is we’ll talk about how our week was, what encounters we had speaking Spanish in public, and any insights or things we learned. This is the actually telling of our journey and how it feels to be trying to learn Spanish in real life. From time to time we’ll have visitors and talk about our encounters as well as guests of other folks that are learning as well and hear their stories.
