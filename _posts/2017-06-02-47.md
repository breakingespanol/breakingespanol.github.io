It's been almost a year since we started this podcast. Amazing how time flies! We've loved sharing our story with you along the whole way. As we looking to grow and expand the show we're going to take a break for the summer as we look into other options (Instagram, YouTube, etc.)

We hope to hear from you about what you've liked the most and that we can return soon!

¡Gracias por Escuchar!
Ben y Jennie
