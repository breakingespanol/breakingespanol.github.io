On this episode we talk a lot about the past few weeks of learning as well as some of the encounters we’ve had trying to speak Spanish in real life. Ben was up in Santa Barbara for some work and had a few opportunities to speak Spanish while Jennie stayed home watching Novelas and eating ice cream. Okay that last part isn’t true, but we do talk about novelas in this show as well as an upcoming law/proposition in California that would open up schools ability to run more bilingual programs.

## Aprendimos Esta Semana (This Week We Learned)
- Use “Como” instead of “Like” when speaking Spanish

- PB in an Elevator = Planta Baja (bottom floor)
- Podria ser = It could be
- Aliento Malo = Bad breath
- Eres fastidioso = You’re annoying
