This week we catch up with each other on how the week was as well as we did our first recording speaking Spanish in the wild! We took a mic with us on a recent journey out and about the town and got a few sound bites of us talking with others in Spanish.

This is the first of many peeks into what it’s really like to be learning a language and trying to speak with other, native Spanish speakers, in the wild. Who knows, maybe we’ll head to a Spanish speaking country soon to get more of these clips for you ;)

Jennie had a bit rougher of a week which is how it goes sometimes. She shares her feelings and thoughts about how it was and possibly what to do next week to make it a better learning week. Enjoy!
