This week we get to hear from Jennie's cousin, Michael Field, who went through a Spanish immersion program as a child and is planning an upcoming study abroad in South America. Michael started his journey at an early age of 5 years old when his parents enrolled him in a Spanish immersion school in Portland, Oregon.

His journey has taken him to and from Spain many times where he lived as an exchange student with a local Spanish family. Throughout his and his sister's life they have had this super-power of speaking the Spanish language fluently and in this episode you get to hear all about what that is like. Enjoy!
