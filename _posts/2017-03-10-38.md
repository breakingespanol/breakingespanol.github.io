We're introducing a new segment where we catch up with each other about the past week in Spanish. Thank you, everyone, for the great feedback about our previous conversations in Spanish for motivating us to do this. We think this will be a good way to share where we are at in our journey as well as help you learn a bit in the process. Enjoy!

Ben was in Santa Barbara last week for work so Jennie was on her own with Jack so we chat about how that went as well as how Ben did up at the LinkedIn Recording studios.

Please help us grow the community by sharing the podcast with people you know and leaving us a review on iTunes or Soundcloud!

¡Gracias por Escuchar!
