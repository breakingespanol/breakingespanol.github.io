We're excited to have our Spanish teacher Lalo Vega back on the program. We start out this episode by speaking in Spanish for several minutes to give you guys an idea of where we're at as well as what a typical class is like for us. After our Spanish convo we had some fun learning Jerga or Slang from Lalo. We even learned some lessons on how to slow down and speak more clearly in Spanish so we are able to improve our level.

¡Gracias por Escuchar!
