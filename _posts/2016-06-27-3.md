In this show we talk about why we decided to raise our son bilingual.

## **Tips**

* We decided while pregnant since we were already learning Spanish

* [Bilingual Types: Coordinate vs Compound](https://www.onehourtranslation.com/translation/blog/being-bilingual-types-bilingualism)

* Our son will have no dividing line between English and Spanish in his brain since he's learning them both at the same time

* Our goal is to help our son have compassion for other cultures

* Through our research we've found very little downsides to teaching him two languages at once

* Don't worry about using Spanglish, but try to separate your languages as much as possible

* If a noun ends in "a" it is generally femanine, which you would use “la” as the pronoun

* Having a nanny has been incredibly helpful in teaching our son Spanish and us!

* Asking for Spanish books for our baby shower has helped us a lot

* Seek out places to speak Spanish

* Host a Spanish night with friends
