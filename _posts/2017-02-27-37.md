It’s been a few weeks since we sat down in the studio so here we catch up on the past few weeks interviewing folks as well as some fun new vocabulary we learned. If you haven’t listened to them yet the past two weeks were interviews with Jennie’s friend Rachel Leake and our Spanish teacher Lalo Vega. We recap those and add our thoughts about what we’ve learned recently.

¡Gracias por Escuchar!
