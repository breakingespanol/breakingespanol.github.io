This week we give some updates in our learning journey including trying to get a SENTRI pass, Spanish play dates, making reservations in Spanish, and using some new apps to help build vocabulary.

We also started back at the Culture and Language center taking lessons and have lots to share. You’ll hear what it feels like to take a year off and some of the things that we got rusty at due to lack of practice. Enjoy!


Palabras Española (Spanish Words)
- Me culpa = My fault
- Ponlo/a zapeta in la basura = Put it in the trash

- Lavate las manos = Wash your hands
- Agradecer = To be thankful
