We’re trying a new format this week! The new format is we’ll talk about how our week was, what encounters we had speaking Spanish in public, and any insights or things we learned.

This is the actually telling of our journey and how it feels to be trying to learn Spanish in real life.

From time to time we’ll have visitors and talk about our encounters as well as guests that are learning as well and hear their stories.

## Ben’s Week
* Almost finished with Duolingo!
* Presented at SD Startup Week
* In Spain they speak with a Lisp and using Vosotros ([ref](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phonological_history_of_Spanish_coronal_fricatives))
* Barcelona is not like the rest of Spain ([ref](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Catalonia))
* Ben met a guy from Mexico City (DF) at a conference and now has a tour guide for his upcoming trip

## Jennie’s Week
* Jennie met someone from Colombia at Gymboree
* They had a connection because our Spanish teacher is from Colombia
* While talking with her the Colombian woman mentioned not to learn from her because she spoke very informal.

## This Week We Learned

## Notes
* There is a new bridge from San Diego to the Tijuana airport to make travel to Mexico easier. More info at the [Cross Border Express](https://www.crossborderxpress.com/node/1) website. The bridge costs $18 to cross and saves tons of time when traveling to/from Mexico.
* Anthony Bordain’s Parts Uknown [episode on Mexico](http://www.cnn.com/video/shows/anthony-bourdain-parts-unknown/season-3/mexico/) is great to watch
