This week we have an interview with Rachel Leake. Rachel is a jet setter with a passion for learning Spanish and immersing herself into Latin culture. She recently went on a solo trip to Chile and had lots of stories to share with us. Enjoy!

Living in South Florida Rachel decided she needed to learn Spanish to enjoy the culture and people more. This is what led her to pickup Duolingo, enroll in Spanish classes and plan a trip to Peru. Since relocating to San Diego less than a year ago, she has continued her lessons at a local school focused on conversational classes.

It was great chatting with her as we're in similar places in our learning journey and hope to join each other more in immersing ourselves in Latin culture and improving our level of speaking Spanish.
