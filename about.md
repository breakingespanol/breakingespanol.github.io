We're Jennie and Ben Sullins. We have a young son named Jack. After a few trips to Europe and Latin America we decided it was time to actually learn a second language. 

Living in Southern California, Spanish was an obvious choice. This podcast is our journey into learning Spanish and immersing ourselves into Latin culture.
